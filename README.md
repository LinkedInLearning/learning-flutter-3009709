In this course, Pooja Bhaumik covers everything a complete beginner needs to get started using Dart and Flutter. Pooja begins with some basic concepts of Dart that you need to understand before using the Flutter framework. Next, she introduces you to Flutter, including Flutter resources that are available, as well as how to install and set up Flutter, select the best version to use, define the anatomy of a Flutter project, and more. Pooja goes over the basic building blocks of Flutter UI, such as building widgets, aligning and placing elements, building dynamic lists, breaking down design into code, and more. She covers interactivity in depth, then goes into everything you need to know about Pubspec. Pooja explains synchronous and asynchronous functions, Postman, the JsonSerializable package, FutureBuilder, and other useful innovations. After discussing how to work with data, Pooja recommends some next steps and points out how you can learn more from Flutter documentation.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
